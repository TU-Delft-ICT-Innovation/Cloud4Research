Terms of Use TU Delft Cloud for Research

1.	**Purpose of the service**

    TU Delft provides all its researchers the opportunity to employ Cloud resources for their research computing needs. Our aim is to allow researchers access to computing and data resources in an accessible way, without the need to engage in lengthy purchasing processes or having to resort to undesirable scenarios.

2.	**Acceptable use**

    Acceptable use of the service is all use in a scientific or educational research context for research that is (co-) owned by TU Delft. So using it for research projects that TU Delft executes, or in (Master) courses for providing resources to students is the primary intended use of the service.

    Using the service for financial gain or personal goals (such as hosting a website showing your CV) is not allowed.

3.	**Terms of use**

    C4R services can be requested by any individual researcher at TU Delft. When approved, the researcher will be the owner of a cloud account. The researcher has full control over this cloud account, with privileges to create (extra) user accounts within this cloud account, in order to provide access to the account to any others involved in the project.

    A request for C4R services must be backed by (at least) one supporter. This supporter must hold the rank of assistant professor or higher.

    A request for C4R services must include an intended end date of the service.

    A request for C4R services must include a financial code (project code or structural code) for billing (see chapter 6)

4.	**Best practices**

    TU Delft will deliver cloud accounts with default settings based on best practices both by the service deliverer (Amazon) and TU Delft. These settings are intended to guard the researcher from unintended mistakes in setting up her cloud resources. 

5.	**Data protection**

    @TODO: We restrict your access to Europe to protect you.

6.	**Costs**

    TU Delft will pre-finance each cloud account with 2000 euros per (calendar)year. This means that if the researcher does not spend more than 2000 euros on cloud resources, no billing will take place and the researcher can use the service essentially “for free”.

    Costs higher than the pre-financed sum will be billed to the financial code that was provided in the initial request. This billing will be performed monthly.

    Please note that tools are available to monitor costs as they develop. Our support team is available to help you asses your predicted costs and set up monitoring for you.
