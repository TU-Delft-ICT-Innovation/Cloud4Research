## I get messages from AWS about an API error. What should I do?
You are probably in a region where you do not have permission to create resources.
Try eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) or eu-west-1 (Ireland).
If you still get these messages, or you need resources that are unavailable in these regions, please contact us **todo**.
