## I am not using my account but still charged costs!

When you do not use your account for a given month, you will probably find that the costs that are charged for that month are not zero! This may mean that you have unknowingly left some resource active, but this is not necessarily so: even when you are not running anything, there is always some activity in your account due to TU Delft's setup.

This activity consists of 2 main parts: we regularly run processes to gather costs, and these processes add cost as well (yes: calculating the bill costs money). The other thing we do is that we check our guardrails to ensure your account is secure. This also runs up costs.

Technically it would be possible for us to seperate the costs of these two processes from the cost that you actually build up using your account, however this would seriously complicate the setup, in the end costing TU Delft much more money than it's worth. Furthermore, these 'inactivity-costs' are extremely low (in the order of 2-3 euros per month). That is why we decided, also given the fact that our base financing is many times higher than this, to leave these costs visible on your account.
